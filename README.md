# Generators explained
## Target audience
Beginners who are familiar with the basics of python. Exposure to basic concepts like iteration using for loops and while loops are required. Knowledge of classes will help.

## Objective
To gain a conceptual understanding of how python generators work, and how to use them to make your code more efficient and sleek.

## Outline
* What are generators? (~5 min)
    * Introduction to standard iteration
    * Iteration using generator functions
        * Infinite series
* Generators in practice - data loading in machine learning (~3 min)
* How do they work? (~7 min)
    * Sending data back into generators
        * Example - Running metric evaluation
    * Stacking generators and the `yield from` statement
        * Example - binary tree traversal
* A brief foray into async and co-routines (~5 min)
    * Understanding `yield from`
    * A simple example of an event loop
